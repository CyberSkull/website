You can make a pledge using PayPal below.

**To complete your pledge and become a backer, you need to:**

1. **Click the payment button corresponding to your desired pledge and pay via PayPal.**
1. **Fill the _Backer subscription_ form below.**

## PayPal backer terms

By pledging via PayPal and filling the form, you accept to get emails from us to give you occasional updates on the project's progress and deliver your rewards.

We will not send you any other promotional emails. Also, you'll only get a couple of emails in total.

Please note that you will _not_ get notifications when we release updates on Kickstarter. As Kickstarter doesn't support PayPal, your pledge will not contribute to the amount displayed on the Kickstarter page.

But you will get your rewards like every other backer, via email.

## Step 1: make your pledge using PayPal

Click the button corresponding to your desired pledge and on the PayPal web page, click the _Send_ button to make the payment:

<ul>
  <li><a class="button-link -yellow -large" href="http://paypal.me/GDQuest/40EUR">
  Learn to Code from Zero - 40€
  </a></li>
  <li><a class="button-link -yellow -large" href="http://paypal.me/GDQuest/95EUR">
  The Course and Ultimate Godot Cookbook - 95€
  </a></li>
  <li><a class="button-link -yellow -large" href="http://paypal.me/GDQuest/265EUR">
  Lifetime Godot Course Mega Bundle - 265€
  </a></li>
</ul>

## Step 2: fill the backer's subscription form

I'll need your PayPal receipt number to register your payment. When you pay via PayPal, you get an email with this number. Look for "Transaction number". The number looks something like `5B889242X9364242J`.

<div class="ml-form-embed" data-account="2869099:u1n3t9l6q4"
data-form="4859708:s1n7c5"></div>

_If the form doesn't appear, please ensure JavaScript is turned on. If you use a browser like Brave, the Shields may prevent the form from appearing. If that happens, please try to open the page in a Private Window._
