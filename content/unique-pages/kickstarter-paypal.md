**PayPal pledges are now closed.**

The Learn to Code from Zero course will be available in pre-order in the coming days.

Below, you will find some of the original information. If you are a PayPal backer and have any issues, you can contact me via our [contact form](https://gdquest.mavenseed.com/p/contact).

<hr>

If you pledged on Kickstarter but your credit card isn't supported, you can use PayPal instead. You'll find all the information below.

**To complete your pledge and become a backer, you need to:**

1. **Click the payment button corresponding to your desired pledge and pay via PayPal.**
1. **Fill the _Backer subscription_ form below.**

## PayPal backer terms

By pledging via PayPal and filling the form, you accept to get emails from us to give you occasional updates on the project's progress and deliver your rewards.

We will not send you any other promotional emails. Also, you'll only get a couple of emails in total.

Please note that you will _not_ get notifications when we release updates on Kickstarter. As Kickstarter doesn't support PayPal, your pledge will not contribute to the amount displayed on the Kickstarter page.

But you will get your rewards like every other backer, via email.

## Your questions

### When will I get access to the rewards?

We'll give you access to the courses you pledged for after November 7, along with other PayPal backers.
