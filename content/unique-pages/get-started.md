## Is it for me?

This free series is **for anyone who wants to learn game creation and Godot**, especially if you're fairly new to programming or learning it.

## Do you struggle to get started?

**How do you get started learning Godot? And how do you become a game developer?**

When starting out, it's hard to know even what or where to search.

There are plenty of tutorials out there that cover little tricks, but they don't really trace a path for you.

And so you try videos and guides _at random_.

The thing is, many of those teach poor programming practices that stick with you and take you to dead ends.

Imagine you took a course to become a chef and all they gave you was a recipe book. No fundamental cutting techniques, no insights choosing the right ingredients, no focused practice. That would be a waste of time, wouldn't it?

Following random step-by-step tutorials is _the same_.

## Becoming a game developer

**To become a game developer, you need more than that.** 

You need to learn how to think like a programmer and solve problems creatively. 

You need to develop the mindset and practice.

And it's hard to know how because it's hardly ever taught in beginner-friendly videos. Most tutors focus on gratifying tactics that give you instant results. Except once you're alone with your game, they don't apply anymore. 

They're just here to keep you engaged with the videos.
