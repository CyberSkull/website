**Godot has tons of nodes packed with time-saving features.**

That's great, but as a result, it takes ages to learn them all.

You have to spend weeks looking for tutorials from many sources only to learn some.

That's why we created **Godot Node Essentials**.

It's an extensive cookbook that will teach you the secrets of Godot's nodes and how to use them in practice.

This new course is out now in early access.

**You can get the first release today with a $40 early adopter discount on the final price.**

Note that Godot Node Essentials is part of our Ultimate Godot course bundle.
