title: 'Kickstarter: learn 2d and 3d game creation with Godot'
---


After a successful crowdfunding to create a Godot course in 2017, we are back with a new project [in collaboration with the Godot team](//godotengine.org/article/gdquest-kickstarter-learn-2d-and-3d-game-creation-godot)!

{{< youtube 7OGxzJQAKmw >}}

We're going to create:

1. **Two complementary courses about 2d and 3d game creation**, based around a platform/adventure game inspired by Metroidvanias
2. **Two beginner-friendly video series for the official documentation** about 2d and 3d
3. Two **Free and Open Source game demos**

However, for that, we need your help.

Interested? You can find all the details on the **[Kickstarter campaign's page](//www.kickstarter.com/projects/gdquest/create-your-own-games-with-godot-the-free-game-eng/)**

In short, we are raising 14,000 â‚¬ to hire Guilherme, Pigdev, and Razvan, to create great tutorials together. And I will keep working alongside them full-time.

This time, we are releasing all our code as Free Software from day one! Both during and after the campaign.

We are also publishing new free tutorials every day during the Kickstarter! So make sure to subscribe to [GDQuest's YoUTube channel](//www.youtube.com/c/gdquest/).

*Our [Open RPG engine](//github.com/GDQuest/godot-open-rpg) is available for anyone to study, distribute, and reuse freely.*

## I've got some questions

If you haven't already, check the [Kickstarter campaign's page](//www.kickstarter.com/projects/gdquest/create-your-own-games-with-godot-the-free-game-eng/). You will find more details there.

Then, I'm here to help. You can reach me [on Twitter](//twitter.com/NathanGDQuest), leave comments [on YouTube](//www.youtube.com/c/gdquest/), or come chat with the community on the [GDQuest Discord server](//discord.gg/87NNb3Z).

Even if you can't back us, a successful campaign will allow us to create more content for the official documentation, and more Free resources. So please consider sharing the word! It's essential for us to keep going.

Thank you kindly for your time.
