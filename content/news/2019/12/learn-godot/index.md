Our [2019 Godot Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gdquest/create-your-own-games-with-godot-the-free-game-eng) included three stretch goals that our backers made possible. One of them was to create a curated list of free content for everyone to learn Godot.

We ended up creating two guides:

1. One for beginners who have little to no programming experience.
1. One for more experienced developers who would like to get up to speed with Godot quickly.

## Read our learning paths now

The learning paths are available now in our new [docs section]({{< ref "docs/_index.md" >}}).

1. [Make Games with Godot: Beginner Edition]({{< ref "tutorial/godot/learning-paths/beginner/index.md" >}}).
1. [Make Games with Godot: Developer Edition]({{< ref "tutorial/godot/learning-paths/developer/index.md" >}}).

## How to use the guides

These documents are in the form of **curated lists of free educational resources**. We looked at all the content creators we could find who make Godot tutorials and hand-picked the one that we felt fit the best.

### Make Games with Godot: Beginner Edition

{{< figure src="/tutorial/godot/learning-paths/beginner/banner.jpg" alt="Beginner Edition" >}}

The beginner edition document is full of hands-on guides. Learning by doing practical projects helps to make quick progress early. That's generally true of programming and especially game development, as it is often visual in nature.

After the first step-by-step projects, you'll find a list of educational resources that explore game design.

The last section encourages you to explore some more in-depth topics such as shaders. They are not as scary as you might think, especially in Godot! 

We also linked to Godot's introduction to math for game developers and a bit of Python. That is because GDScript, the primary scripting language in Godot, is inspired by Python.

### Make Games with Godot: Developer Edition

{{< figure src="/tutorial/godot/learning-paths/developer/banner.png" atl="Developer Edition">}}

This guide is for professional developers or those of you who are coming from other game engines. It starts with guides to get you up to speed with Godot coming from other engines.

Then, we focus on the UI framework and theme system, as these are essential yet not well-known at the time of writing. To give you an idea of their power, the entire editor relies on the engine's own UI system.

We follow up with a deep-dive into shader land, look at extending Godot with plugins and tool scripts, networking, and a cool advanced tutorial by [Bastiaan Olij](https://twitter.com/mux213) on vehicle simulation.

We wrap up with two more useful lists for anyone that dives into complex problems: 

1. How to get help when you are stuck with the engine.
2. A list of top-quality extra resources to explore that are not Godot-specific yet very useful.

## Contributing

These guides are living documents. If you want to suggest high quality resources to enrich the guide, check out our [contributor's guidelines]({{< ref "docs/guidelines/contributing-to/learn-godot/index.md" >}}).

We want to thank our backers kindly: without your help, we could not afford to open source so much of our work.

We hope you'll enjoy the guides!
