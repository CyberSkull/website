_It has been a while since the last behind the scenes news post. There's been good progress with the tutorials and the brushes. I've been hard at work lately, especially changing my workflow to increase production speed, maintaining the same quality. On the other hand, I haven't been able to update the website and social networks as often as I would've liked. Aside from that..._

## Krita 3.0.1 is out!

There's also an [experimental Mac build](//krita.org/en/item/experimental-osx-build-available/) with openGL support! It needs extensive testing, so if you're a Mac user, it's time to get your hands dirty.

## The Swiss Game Academy

At the Game Academy, we were a team of 15 people to take care of dozens of students, and we took turns to train them in the morning. I was there to show how to create game sprites with Krita, and to hopefully convince hobbyists that they didn't need Photoshop! Few of them had ever heard of the program, and most were quite impressed with its features, including other members of the staff. The wraparound mode, symmetry drawing tools, the pop-up palette, and more importantly PSD support seduced many. Over the course of 3 hours, we covered all of the fundamentals, and went through the whole asset creation workflow.

That's the last event I accepted to be part of, and that until the whole Kickstarter project is done. It was great though!

## Ludum Dare 36 <small>learning Godot, preparing the next series</small>

Coming back from Switzerland, there was the 36<sup>th</sup> edition of the Ludum Dare. I took this opportunity to prepare the next training series for Game Art Quest: the one where we'll focus on creating games sprites. I made a very small game that showcases what you can do with static game assets. The project is set in the world of David Revoy's [Pepper and Carrot](//www.peppercarrot.com/), with our favorite ginger cat as the main character.

It's a small isometric 2D game where a cat throws ridiculous spells at scarecrows and ghosts. Alright, I'll figure out a nicer introduction for the course release! At that occasion, I learned how to work with Godot 2.1, which deeply impressed me. It came a long way since version 1.0. It feels a lot more polished, and it's well documented. Within 3 days, I managed to get a small working prototype. There's work left to polish it a bit, but it'll give us a nice base project for the game art workshops, where I'll show you how to replace my sprites and put your own art into the game!

## Krita tutorials: where are we at?

We've passed the halfway mark! You now have more than 6 hours of tutorials available [on Gumroad](//gum.co/krita-tutorial-for-game-artists) (_if you backed the initial Kickstarter, you got a coupon via email_). There's one chapter left in the first volume, dedicated to Krita's animation features. I know that a lot of you are waiting eagerly for this series, and it's around the corner!

<!-- TODO: Screenshot -->

Game Art Quest doesn't end there. After that, I will focus on the game art workshops, in which we will explore 2 different art styles: painterly, and cel shaded. At the same time, we will learn more about the constraints we face with camera angles as 2D game artists. Exploring side-scrolling and isometric games will be a great occasion to talk about how we can achieve good atmospheric perspective and decent character proportions.

I will do my best to provide you as much information as possible on the topics. Contrary to the first volume though, it has to be a real workshop. You'll get to create your own sprites along with the videos, and if you do all of the assignments, you'll end up with your own game mockup at the end. This workshop series will take me a few more months to create, especially as I'm flying off to Japan in October (holidays!). And you can expect this second series to be about 5 hours long.

## Off to Japan

I have travelled very little so far, and it'll be my first time on a long-haul flight. It's also a personal treat after a few years working in the gaming industry, taking little time off, and creating GDQuest 18 months ago. It'll be a great occasion to fully relax, and come back to full productivity in November.

That said, it's time to get back to work. Well, actually to share dinner with a few friends, at the time of writing. But you know what I mean!

See you soon.
