# Recommended graphic tablets

[Omitted long matching line]

## Flat tablets

_Flat tablets are perfect for everyone to start with at a low price. Especially students and hobbyists._

1. Huion H610 pro (80$) - [review](//frenden.com/post/87110791272/huion-h610-pro-h610-k58-graphics-tablet-review)
2. Wacom Intuos Pro Medium or Large (300-500$)

## Screen tablets

_Screen tablets are worth a try if you're an experienced artist already, and you do a lot of line work._

1. Huion GT-220 (21.5" HD screen, 800$) - [review](//frenden.com/image/118056589592)
2. Monoprice 19" (1440*900 resolution, 400$) - [review](//frenden.com/post/69444810884/review-monoprice-19-tablet-monitor-wacom-take)
3. Wacom Cintiq 13HD (13" HD screen, 800$)

## Tips

1. **Always** download and install the driver from the manufacturer's official website **before** you plug your device in! This will save you some trouble.
2. As far as Wacom tablets are concerned, you can pretty safely buy second hand devices! That's how I got mine, and after years of frequent use, they still work perfectly.
3. At the time I'm writing this, Krita doesn't support every single tablet on the market. The developers are in the process of re-writing their tablet code. Wacom tablets work OK, but some other brands might not until Krita 3.0's release.
4. If you want to use 2 tablets at the same time like I'm doing, they have to share the same brand. In other words, you can't use a flat Wacom tablet and a Wacom cintiq at the same time.
