**Learn a breadth of techniques** professionals use to create 2D games!

After creating three Godot courses about shaders, visual effects, and procedural generation, we're working on an extensive 2D game creation course: **Godot 2D Secrets**.

It's on Kickstarter since August 15, and it got funded in less than 48 hours.

As always, we are open-sourcing all our code and pledge to create a lot of free educational resources thanks to the community's support.

We already have exciting topics planned like turn-based RPG combat, real-time simulation, visual novels, and many more, based on your needs and requests.

You can find all the details on the [Kickstarter campaign page](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gdquest/godot-2d-secrets-level-up-your-game-creation-skills) below.

We are also creating many videos on the [GDQuest channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/Gdquest/videos) during the campaign. I'm trying out new formats like this one-minute tutorial about creating a laser:

Back us now to get the course at a lower price and directly fund dozens of free tutorials and open-source demos.

Don't forget to stay creative, have fun, and let's see one another in the next one.
