title: Godot 3 Close and Ranged Attack Tutorials
---

Last week we did a tutorial about attack mechanics in collaboration with Heartbeast. I got important feedback from you, the backers, and wanted to apply it to a self-contained tutorial. Consider it as a bonus while we're waiting for Godot 3 beta.

**Close combat attack**:

1. [Weapon collision programming](//youtu.be/JBczf8qt04c)

**Heartbeast's tutorial**:

1. [Ranged attack: fireball](//www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY7wzK59-Jw)

It shows some of Godot's strengths:

- **Inherited scenes** act as a base class that child scenes derive from, but you control it all through the editor.
- **Gameplay controlled animation**. The two available weapons share a common Weapon.gd script. Their speed, the attacks' anticipation, their visibility, and their collisions are all controlled by the animation.

The powerful Call Function and Transform animation tracks are broken in the unstable releases. So I could not use them for the tutorial. We'll look into that in the course. As Ben released his last Game Maker course last month, he had a little bit of time to do a collab. That was a good opportunity to make some training material. The demo is also open source, available for the entire Godot community.

While we're at it, it's more than time to give a **shout out to the Kicsktarter's four sponsors**. Three company owners and Mario Fux, the organizer of the Randa Meetings, supported the campaign with important pledges. They also are Godot supporters.

## Gamblify

They worked with several engines in the past, starting with Ogre3D, Cocos and Unity. They now use Godot and are among the biggest donors. They not only helped to fund Godot 3.0 with donations in 2016 and this year: they plan to keep supporting the developers regularly.

Their latest game, Monsters from Outer Space, is a Godot game.

Mario is a kind, busy teacher, developer, and free software advocate. Every year he organizes the large [Randa meetings](//randa-meetings.ch/) in Switzerland for the KDE foundation. I joined them in 2016 to eat swiss delicacies give a hand and meet fellow developers. Along with the school he works at, they supported both Kickstarter campaigns.
