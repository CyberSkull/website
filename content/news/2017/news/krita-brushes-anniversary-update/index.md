title: Krita Brushes Anniversary Update
---

It's been a year already. 12 months, 12 consecutive updates. This anniversary release may not seem like much, but it's certainly the biggest so far. I redesigned all the brushes from scratch! The new thumbnails are circular. That way, all the information they can convey is available whether you look at the pop-up palette or the presets list. The design is also unique so that itâ€™s easy to differentiate from other bundles.

The updated design reads a lot better when the thumbnails get small. If you work on a laptop, a tablet, or if you have a lot of presets in the docker, you can now spot the one you want faster.

    caption="The old brushes and the new ones in the presets docker. That's quite a change, isn't it?"
    alt="Comparison of the old brush thumbnails and the new ones" >}}

There are up to 4 elements in each thumbnail:

1. **The base** or background color indicates the bundle a brush belongs to
1. **The outline** shows which family the preset belongs to
1. **The pictogram**, in the top-right corner, tells you what the brush is intended for
1. **The stroke** is prominent, in the center

I wrote a python script to automate the process, and make it easier to improve them moving forward. As this is a big change, I'm counting on you to tell me what you think!

## 30% off until May 1st

The update is in your library already. And to celebrate its anniversary, the premium brushes are on sale this week-end: you'll save 3 euros off the standard version and 7.5 euros off the premium one!
