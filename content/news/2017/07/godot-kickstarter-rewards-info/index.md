**You will get all your rewards, votes and major news via email**, starting this week. So be sure that you've set the right address on Kickstarter. Feel free to send me a message on Kickstarter or an email if you have any trouble. Don't forget to:

1. Add nathan[at]gdquest.com to your contacts
1. Check your spam folder if you didn't get anything on Sunday


## When you will get your access keys

**Discord**: check out the email you got to access the server.

**Krita courses**: if you got the **Craftsman tier and above, you will automatically get the 3 products delivered to your Kickstarter/PayPal email address**. You'll get 1 email from Gumroad for each product, that you can add to your Gumroad library. 

_NB: a bug currently prevents you from adding the products to your library that way. I got in touch with the platform's support team to get it fixed. You'll get the course as soon as we find a solution._

**The Godot course**: you will get early-access by early October. That's the latest Estimated Time of Arrival. There'll be plenty of content and updates by then.

**Contributions**: I'll work on the contributions and the course in parallel. Godot 3.0 will attract a lot of new users around its release, and improved docs could help them stick. That's why I'd like to help the developers this summer.

## The vote and the bonus tutorial series

We will take **1 week to discuss** the list of themes for the stretch goals on Discord. Then, you will have **2 to 4 weeks to vote** , using a form you'll get via email around mid-July.

I will ultimately setup a list of 20 to 40 topics based on what's feasible and useful to the greater number. I'll favor general techniques over specific game mechanics.


## What I've been up to last week

Although I'm back to work since last week, I'm still recovering. If you wondered why you didn't get a news post sooner: I'm just slower than usual, and I've had a lot to do during the past week. The campaign's incredible success means the company has to evolve, and there'll be more administrative work and charges to pay from now on.

Aside from that, I've open sourced my [Blender video editing add-on](//github.com/GDQuest/GDQuest-VSE). The average tutorial has more than 100 cuts, and I needed tools to do that as efficiently as possible. It's still not ready for public use, but at least it's out there, so anyone can check it out, and start playing with the features. If there are users, you can expect me to improve it a bit faster!
