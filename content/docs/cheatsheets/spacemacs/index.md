description: A list of some features I find most useful in Spacemacs.

Here is my living cheatsheet, a growing list of vim tips and spacemacs features I find particularly useful.
<!-- Use shortcuts template and data? -->

## Jumps ##

In Spacemacs, jumps are bound to <kbd>SPC</kbd> <kbd>J</kbd>. Some of these features help you to navigate around your text or code fast.

You can combine jumps with any command. For instance, `d`, delete, followed by a jump, will delete to the jump location.

- <kbd>SPC</kbd> <kbd>j</kbd> <kbd>j</kbd>: Jump anywhere in visible windows by typing the characters you want to jump to. `avy-goto-char-timer`
- <kbd>SPC</kbd> <kbd>j</kbd> <kbd>w</kbd>: Jump to a word in any visible window by typing its first character. `avy-goto-word-or-subword-1`
- <kbd>SPC</kbd> <kbd>j</kbd> <kbd>i</kbd>: Jump to a title, a function definition, a class, etc. anywhere inside the current buffer with helm. Type patterns to filter down the list and press <kbd>RET</kbd> to jump.
- <kbd>SPC</kbd> <kbd>s</kbd> <kbd>s</kbd>: Swoop, search the current file for patterns, and navigate to the matching lines. Use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> <kbd>n</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> <kbd>p</kbd> to navigate to the **n**ext and **p**revious search results. You can do a lot with this feature, but you can also use it to intuitively move around your file.

I define some custom shortcuts for the tools I use the most amongst the features above. That way I can jump to words with one keystroke, instead of three.

In your configuration file, init.el (<kbd>SPC</kbd> <kbd>f</kbd> <kbd>e</kbd> <kbd>d</kbd>), in the `user-config` function, add:

```lisp
(define-key evil-normal-state-map (kbd "M-s") #'avy-goto-char-timer)
(define-key evil-normal-state-map (kbd "M-w") #'avy-goto-word-1)
```

To synchronize the settings, you can press <kbd>SPC</kbd> <kbd>f</kbd> <kbd>e</kbd> <kbd>R</kbd>.

This will allow you to "search" any character on screen with <kbd>M-s</kbd>, and to jump to a word with <kbd>M-w</kbd>.

### Vim commands ###

Here are some Vim commands I use to jump a lot:

- <kbd>\*</kbd>: Search the word under the cursor jumping forward.
- <kbd>\#</kbd>: Search the word under the cursor jumping backward.
- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> <kbd>d</kbd>: Move **d**own half a page
- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> <kbd>u</kbd>: Move **u**p half a page
- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> <kbd>f</kbd>: Move **f**orward one page.
- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> <kbd>b</kbd>: Move **b**ack one page.

## Vim extras ##

To add a function text object, add the following function to your configuration file:

```lisp
(evil-define-text-object evil-outer-function (count)
  (interactive)
  (save-mark-and-excursion
    (mark-defun)
    (let ((m (mark)))
      (if (looking-back "*/\n")
          (progn
            (previous-line)
            (list m (first (sp-get-comment-bounds))))
        (list m (point))))))
```

And add a key for it in the evil outer text objects keymap:

```lisp
(define-key evil-outer-text-objects-map "d" 'evil-outer-function)
```
