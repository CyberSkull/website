# Guidelines

In the following pages, you will find our **best practices** and guidelines. They are the result of years of experience working in game development, programming, and education.

We use these documents at GDQuest to code efficiently, to make good tutorials, and to improve the quality and consistency of our work over time.

If you want to contribute to one of our projects, you'll want to take a look at the next pages.
