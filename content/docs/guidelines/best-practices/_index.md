# Best Practices

In this section you'll find _best practices and guidelines_ on a variety of topics: communicating and making videos, programming [Blender](//www.blender.org/) add-ons with [Python](//python.org) and programming in [Godot](//godotengine.org). At GDQuest, **we strive for high quality** in what we do and by sharing our knowledge, gathered over many years of building tools, projects and content, we hope that other people will have an easier time creating quality products as well.
