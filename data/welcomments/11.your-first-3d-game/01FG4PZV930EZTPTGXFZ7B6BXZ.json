  "message": "Hi, Nathan! Thank you so much for these online free tutorials. On this one (https://www.gdquest.com/tutorial/godot/learning-paths/getting-started-in-2021/chapter/11.your-first-3d-game/), I made it all the way to the 3D game.\n\nI have a sort of \"meta-question\": Where can we ask questions about this tutorial? Is there a reddit group? Or a forum somewhere?\n\nI have a couple of questions that have been puzzling me as I have been working through the 3D tutorial, and I can't seem to resolve them..\n\nThanks again.."
