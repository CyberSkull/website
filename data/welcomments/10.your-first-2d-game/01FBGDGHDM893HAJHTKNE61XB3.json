  "message": "You only had to press ENTER after duplication\nYet I still had to BCKSPACE\n\nI really am curious about this since I'm sure I'll be using duplication a lot\n\nIt's currently better for me to copy the code and then paste it after moving down (ENTER, then BCKSPACE, then PASTE)\n\nInstead of duplicating, moving back, then forth to get rid of highlight, then ENTER space, then BCKSPACE"
