How are you?\n\nFirst of all, thank you very very much for all the tutorials, I appreciate very much your work.\n\nSaying that, I would like to ask your help, because I have submitted my email for the email daily course, but every time I confirm my email nothing happens, I've tried like 4 times and yet nothing happens, maybe it's because I'm in Venezuela and there may be restrictions for this zone but I tried using a VPN as well and nothing happens, I haven't received the daily email course and I would really like to learn with it.\n\nHaving said that, I would like to thank you again for all the high quality material you have made, and I hope you can help me with my issue, thanks in advance.\n\nAlejandro."
