  "message": "I couldn't save the Grid script until I created a root node, which wasn't specified in the tutorial.  This created a scene which again, was not mentioned in the tutorial.  Without doing this, the Grid resource does not appear when attempting to add a new Resource in the FileSystem. Is there a way to create the Grid.gd file without a scene?  This really confused me."
