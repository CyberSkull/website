  "message": "I had the same issue as Daniel.\nI created the script as in your option 2. When pressing ctrl-s to save I got that error that a root node is required. Also when creating the new resource I could not find \"Grid\".\nClosing Godot and Reopening fixed the issue. (The script was now \"saved\" and I could locate it when creating \"New Resource\")",
