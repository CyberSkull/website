  "message": "I'm unable to make my player jump with space bar, W, or the up arrow key. I went through the instruction and also copied/pasted the code from the example with no success. I also made sure gravity was set to 4k like the instructor did. My collision mask, and speed/direction variables have the same values. He just won't jump."
